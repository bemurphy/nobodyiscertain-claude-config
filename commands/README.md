1. Reads an existing PRD or ERD file
2. Generates high-level parent tasks and waits for approval
3. Breaks down each parent task into actionable sub-tasks
4. Identifies relevant files that need to be created or modified
5. Saves to `/tasks/tasks-[document-name].md`

### Implementation

#### `/task-orchestrator`

Orchestrate task implementation with specialized implementer and architect review agents.

**What it does:**
1. Reads a task list file
2. Identifies the next uncompleted task
3. Spawns an **Implementer Agent** to complete the task
4. Spawns a **Review Architect Agent** to review the implementation
5. Presents review feedback to you
6. Waits for your approval before proceeding
7. Runs `/smart-commit` to commit changes
8. Marks task complete and moves to the next task

**Usage:**
```bash
# Point to your task list
/task-orchestrator tasks/tasks-user-auth.md
```

**The command will:**
- ‚úÖ Work through tasks sequentially
- ‚úÖ Use specialized agents (implementer + reviewer) for each task
- ‚úÖ Present implementation and review for your approval
- ‚úÖ **Pause after each task** - you control the flow
- ‚úÖ Create focused commits with `/smart-commit`

**What it does:**
1. Implements tasks one sub-task at a time with approval checks
2. Enforces proper completion protocol (test ‚Üí stage ‚Üí commit)
3. Maintains task list and relevant files section
4. Ensures clean git workflow

**Usage:**
```bash
# When you're ready to start implementing a task list
/process-task-list

# Claude will follow the task list workflow, asking permission between sub-tasks
```

**The command enforces:**
- ‚úÖ One sub-task at a time (waits for your "yes" or "y")
- ‚úÖ Mark sub-tasks `[x]` immediately upon completion
- ‚úÖ When parent task complete: run tests ‚Üí stage ‚Üí clean up ‚Üí commit
- ‚úÖ Descriptive commit messages with task context
- ‚úÖ Keep "Relevant Files" section updated
- ‚úÖ No surprises - explicit permission required for each step

**Completion Protocol:**
```bash
# For each sub-task:
1. Implement the sub-task
2. Mark it [x] in the task list
3. Stop and ask permission

# When all sub-tasks done:
1. Run relevant tests
2. If tests pass: git add .
3. Clean up temporary files
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Mark parent task [x]
```

### Workspace Management

#### `/worktree-setup`

Create an isolated git worktree with proper feature branch for large features.

**What it does:**
1. Asks for feature name and ticket reference
2. Creates feature branch following naming convention
3. Sets up worktree in `.worktrees/` directory
4. Ensures `.worktrees/` is gitignored
5. Provides next steps and workflow guidance

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start a new large feature in isolation
/worktree-setup
```

**The command will:**
- ‚úÖ Create worktree at `<repo>/.worktrees/<branch-name>/`

- Want isolation from main codebase
- Need to work on multiple things in parallel
- Giving AI agent a sandbox

**Benefits:**
- Separate workspace for big features
- No branch switching needed
- Resume work by just `cd`-ing to directory
- Main repo stays clean

---

#### `/worktree-finish`

Clean up a completed worktree after feature is merged.

**What it does:**
1. Detects if you're in a worktree
2. Checks branch and PR status (merged/open/closed)
3. Warns about uncommitted changes or unpushed commits
4. Asks for confirmation
5. Removes worktree and deletes local branch
6. Returns you to main repo on main branch

**Usage:**
```bash
# After your PR is merged
/worktree-finish
```

**The command will:**
- ‚úÖ Verify PR is merged (using `gh` if available)
- ‚úÖ Warn about uncommitted/unpushed changes
- ‚úÖ Navigate back to main repo
- ‚úÖ Update main branch
- ‚úÖ Remove worktree directory

### Git & Commits

#### `/smart-commit`

Intelligently analyzes your changes and creates focused, meaningful commits.

**What it does:**
1. Checks if you're on `main` - if so, automatically creates a feature branch
2. Analyzes all staged and unstaged changes
3. Groups changes by topic/feature
4. Creates separate commits for each logical change
5. Writes meaningful commit messages following git guidelines

**Usage:**
```bash
# After making changes, simply run:
/smart-commit
```

**The command will:**
- ‚úÖ Automatically create feature branch if on main
  - With ticket: `<TICKET>-jdw-claude-<feature>` (e.g., `MDZ-10-jdw-claude-add-comments`)
  - Without ticket: `jdw-claude-<feature>` (e.g., `jdw-claude-refactor-orders`)
- ‚úÖ Analyze git diff to understand what changed
- ‚úÖ Split unrelated changes into separate commits
- ‚úÖ Write descriptive commit messages (no "feat:", "fix:" prefixes)
- ‚úÖ Follow imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- ‚úÖ Show final git status

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Single feature**
```bash
# You modified: app/models/user.rb, app/controllers/users_controller.rb
/smart-commit
# Result: 1 commit - "Add user authentication with Devise"
```

**Scenario 2: Multiple features**
```bash
# You modified:
# - app/models/comment.rb (new feature)
# - app/controllers/comments_controller.rb (new feature)
# - app/models/article.rb (bug fix)
/smart-commit
# Result: 2 commits
#   1. "Add Comment model and controller"
#   2. "Fix article validation for published status"
```

**Scenario 3: On main branch**
```bash
# Current branch: main
# With ticket in context (e.g., working on MDZ-10)
/smart-commit
# Result:
#   1. Creates branch "MDZ-10-jdw-claude-add-comments"
#   2. Commits changes with proper messages

# Without ticket
/smart-commit
# Result:
#   1. Creates branch "jdw-claude-add-comments"
#   2. Commits changes with proper messages
```

---

#### `/create-pr`

Create a pull request from the current branch, defaulting to draft mode.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes all changes since the branch diverged from the base branch
2. Examines all commits (not just the latest) to understand the complete feature
3. Creates a descriptive PR title and summary
4. Pushes to remote if needed
5. Creates a draft PR with `gh pr create --draft`
6. Returns the PR URL

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create a draft PR (default)
/create-pr

# Create a ready PR
/create-pr --ready

# Specify a different base branch
/create-pr --base develop
```

**The command will:**
- ‚úÖ Analyze ALL commits in the branch (not just the latest)
- ‚úÖ Create comprehensive PR summary based on all changes
- ‚úÖ Include a test plan checklist
- ‚úÖ Push to remote with `-u` flag if needed
- ‚úÖ Create PR in draft mode by default
- ‚úÖ Return the PR URL for easy access

**PR Format:**
```markdown
## Summary
- Bullet point 1 covering key changes
- Bullet point 2 covering key changes
- Bullet point 3 covering key changes

## Test plan
- [ ] Test item 1
- [ ] Test item 2
- [ ] Test item 3

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

**Options:**
- `--ready` or `--no-draft` - Create PR in ready state instead of draft
- `--base <branch>` - Specify base branch (defaults to main)

**When to use:**
- After completing work on a feature branch
- When changes are ready for review (or close to ready)
- To quickly create a draft PR for early feedback

**Safety features:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always analyzes complete branch history
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pushes to remote if not already pushed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Defaults to draft to prevent accidental ready PRs
